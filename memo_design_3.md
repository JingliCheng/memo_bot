Totally fair. You can 100% ship a **lighter, “free-style” memory** that’s reliable enough without building a full ontology. Here’s a lean design that keeps your **Profile Card + Conversation Summaries**, uses embeddings to spot overlaps, and asks an LLM only when needed to **merge / update / discard**.

---

# Core principles (simple + safe)

1. **One canonical Profile Card** (short description + bullet points, ≤200 tokens).
2. **Session Summaries** (one per session, ≤120–200 tokens each).
3. **Embeddings for near-dup detection** (no predicates/ontology).
4. **LLM only as a *judge*** to merge/update/delete when duplicates are suspected.
5. **Snapshots + rollbacks** to recover from bad merges.

---

# Data model (minimal)

### `profile_card.md` (always-injected)

* `id, user_id, text, updated_at, version`
* Example format:

  * **One-liner:** who the user is + 1–2 key traits
  * **Bullets (5–10):** stable preferences, constraints, current goal

### `session_summary`

```json
{
  "id": "ss_2025-09-05_01",
  "user_id": "u1",
  "date": "2025-09-05",
  "summary": "We talked about ...",
  "embedding": [...],
  "tokens": 138
}
```

### `history`

* Keep last N `profile_card` **snapshots** (e.g., 7) with `version` & timestamp.

---

# Write path (end of each session)

1. **Summarize the session (LLM)**

   * Target 120–200 tokens.
   * Include: new facts, important events, decisions, unresolved items.

2. **Near-dup check (Embeddings)**

   * Compute embedding for new summary.
   * ANN search in `session_summaries` → top-M (e.g., M=10).
   * If any cosine sim ≥ **0.92** → likely duplicate.
   * If 0.80–0.92 → likely overlap; send to **LLM judge**.
   * Else < 0.80 → **insert as new**.

3. **LLM judge (only when overlap)**
   Instruction (succinct):

   ```
   You are reconciling two session summaries for the same user.
   Decide: MERGE | UPDATE_OLD | KEEP_BOTH | DISCARD_NEW.
   - MERGE: produce a single, shorter, non-redundant summary (≤ 200 tokens).
   - UPDATE_OLD: the new info supersedes; output a revised single summary (≤ 200 tokens).
   - KEEP_BOTH: both contain distinct info; return both unchanged.
   - DISCARD_NEW: new adds no value; keep old.
   Return strict JSON: { "action": "...", "summary_1": "...", "summary_2?": "..." }
   ```

   Heuristics before calling LLM:

   * If `len(new) < 60` and sim ≥ 0.90 → **DISCARD\_NEW** automatically.
   * If new contains **explicit changes** (“moved to…”, “now…”) → bias to **UPDATE\_OLD**.

4. **Apply decision**

   * **MERGE / UPDATE\_OLD** → write the merged text as the **kept summary** (keep one row; update `embedding`).
   * **KEEP\_BOTH** → store new as separate row.
   * **DISCARD\_NEW** → drop.

5. **Update Profile Card (optional, lightweight)**

   * Feed the **last K summaries** (e.g., K=5) + current card into a tiny prompt:
     “Regenerate the Profile Card (≤ 200 tokens). Preserve stable facts; add only high-confidence updates. Keep bullets sorted by importance. If uncertain, omit.”
   * Save **snapshot** of old card; write the new one as the canonical.

---

# Read path (per turn)

* **Always inject** `profile_card.md`.
* For context, retrieve **top-R (e.g., 3–6) session summaries** by embedding similarity to the **current user message**.
* Hard token caps: Profile ≤200; Summaries ≤400–600 total; trim by priority (similarity).

---

# Dedup & merge thresholds (reasonable defaults)

* **Exact/near-dup:** sim ≥ **0.92** → treat as duplicate (auto DISCARD\_NEW unless new is longer/clearer → MERGE).
* **Overlap:** **0.80–0.92** → send to LLM judge.
* **Distinct:** < **0.80** → keep as new.

> These keep costs low: LLM judge only runs on \~10–20% of sessions.

---

# Guardrails (so “freedom style” doesn’t drift)

* **Cap counts:** keep **last 60–120** session summaries; older ones go to cold storage or are auto-merged into an **epoch summary** (e.g., monthly).
* **No chain-of-merges:** avoid degrading quality—don’t merge a summary that was itself merged in the last 24h.
* **Stability filter for Profile Card:** only promote items seen **≥2 times across ≥2 days** (or explicitly stated by user) to the card; else leave in session summaries.
* **Rollback:** keep **7 profile snapshots**; restore on anomaly.

---

# Token & latency budget

* **Per turn** (no profile search):

  * 1 embedding for the query (+ maybe 1 for goal)
  * ANN on `session_summaries` (fast)
  * Re-embed not needed; re-rank is simple math
  * Inject: Profile Card (≤200) + top-R summaries (≤600)
* **Per session end:** 1 LLM summarization; 0–1 LLM judge calls (only if overlap).
* This stays snappy and cheap.

# Minimal prompts you can copy

**Session summarizer**

```
Summarize the session for future recall (≤ 180 tokens).
Include: new facts, key events, decisions, unresolved items.
Be specific, avoid fluff, no repeated info from prior summaries.
```

**LLM judge (merge/update/delete)**

```
Given OLD and NEW session summaries for the same user, decide:
MERGE | UPDATE_OLD | KEEP_BOTH | DISCARD_NEW.
- MERGE/UPDATE_OLD: return a single concise result (≤ 200 tokens).
Output strict JSON: { "action": "...", "summary_1": "...", "summary_2?": "..." }
Prefer discarding if NEW adds no unique value. Prefer update if NEW clearly supersedes OLD.
```

**Profile card generator**

```
Using the last K session summaries and the current profile card, produce a new Profile Card (≤ 200 tokens):
- One-line description + 5–10 bullet points.
- Keep stable facts; add only high-confidence updates seen on ≥2 different days or explicitly confirmed.
- Omit uncertain details. Keep bilingual preference notes if present.
Return plain text only.
```

# Pros & tradeoffs

**Pros**

* Simple, fast, and easy to reason about.
* No ontology/predicate registry required.
* Natural fit for TalkyDino MVP.
* Still handles duplicates/overlaps with *targeted* LLM calls.

**Tradeoffs**

* Less granular updates than S-P-O facts (harder to do precise conflict logic).
* Some risk of “summary drift” (mitigated by snapshots + stability filter).
* Temporal queries (“what happened last Tuesday?”) rely on summary timestamps, not structured fields.

---

# Easy upgrades later (when you’re ready)

* Add **light tags** to summaries (e.g., `["preference", "move", "school"]`)—still free-form, no ontology.
* Keep a tiny side-table of **2–5 critical facts** (timezone, name, allergy) as key-value pairs, regenerated from the card (no predicates needed).
* Add a monthly **epoch summarizer** to compress old summaries safely.

---

# TL;DR

Yes—**Profile Card + Session Summaries + Embedding dedup + LLM judge** is a solid, shippable memory system. It keeps complexity low, costs predictable, and gives you levers (thresholds, snapshots, caps) to stay safe. You can grow into a structured/MECE approach later without throwing this away.
